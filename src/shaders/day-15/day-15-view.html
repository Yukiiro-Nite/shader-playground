  The original intention was to use the last frame as an input to the next frame.
  Then I could mix the previous frame with the new frame to create a phosphor effect.

  As you can see, it does not work. It turns out that the drawing buffer is not preserved,
  so I can not get the pixels from the previous frame unless it is preserved.
  Apparently, preserving the drawing buffer also has negative impacts on performance.

  <i>I need to experiment more with this.</i>
